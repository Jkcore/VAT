# VAERS Analysis Tool 
## Purpose
  - In light of recent events many Americans have become aware of the VAERS data that the government compiles and makes available. With misinformation surrnounding vaccinations and the symptoms that they cause the VAERS Analysis Tool or VAT is a tool that will provide some insight into vaccines, symptoms, and the patterns surrounding them.

## Extensibility
  ### As I am not a stastician, there will be a bit of a learning curve as to how to represent the data. A few ideas for what should be provided are as follows:
  - Scatter plot of a given vaccine and a given side effect (to show positive, negative, or neutral correlation) / trendline for that scatterplot.
  -  Percentage change year over year 
  -  Linear regression (simple and multiple), polynomial regression.
  -  
  ### I'm sure this will grow as I figure out what the fuck to do with all the data.
