# VAERS Analysis Tool 
## Purpose
  - In light of recent events many Americans have become aware of the VAERS data that the government compiles and makes available. With misinformation surrnounding vaccinations and the symptoms that they cause the VAERS Analysis Tool or VAT is a tool that will provide some insight into vaccines, symptoms, and the patterns surrounding them.

## Extensibility
  ### As I am not a statistician, there will be a bit of a learning curve as to how to represent the data. I'm sure the list will grow as I figure out more ways of analyzing this shit. A few ideas for what should be provided are as follows:
  - Scatter plot of a given vaccine and a given side effect (to show positive, negative, or neutral correlation) / trendline for that scatterplot.
  -  Percentage change year over year 
  -  Linear regression (simple and multiple), polynomial regression.

## Is this the end all be all definitive guide to whether or not a vaccine is safe? 
 - No, I'm not the one who can tell someone whether or not something is safe. But performing analysis on data to make decisions is better than no analysis at all.
